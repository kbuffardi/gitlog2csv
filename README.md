# gitlog2csv

**gitlog2csv** is a python tool for creating a CSV spreadsheet that summarizes git commits

## Getting Started

**gitlog2csv** requires:

* [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

To run **gitlog2csv** from the commandline:

1. Download and copy `gitlog2csv.py` into the project's directory
2. From that directory, run the command: `python gitlog2csv.py`
3. If it runs without error, it will create a new file with the convention: *project*-gitlog.csv where *project is the directory's name.

If you get an python error message, you may need to update python (to 3.5 or greater) or run step 2 with `python3` if your system defaults to a previous version of python.
